# Social Network API

## Description

This is a RESTful API built for a social networking web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. It uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM to handle large amounts of unstructured data. This API forms the back end part of a full-stack web application.

## User Story

``AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
